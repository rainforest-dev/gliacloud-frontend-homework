WEBVTT

00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:10.501
Hi, Welcome to Design
Live Activities for Apple Watch.

00:00:10.718 --> 00:00:11.625
My name is Ed.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.562
And my name is Taylor,

00:00:13.583 --> 00:00:15.773
and we’re designers
on the Apple Design Team.

00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:18.685
Together, we’ll go through
everything you need to know

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:21.156
to design great
Live Activities for Apple Watch.

00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:23.687
What we’ll talk about today,

00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:27.652
builds upon many of the changes
we introduced in watchOS 10

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.531
which was the most significant change
to Apple Watch since its introduction.

00:00:33.363 --> 00:00:36.779
In addition to an entirely new user
interface focused on glanceability,

00:00:37.135 --> 00:00:40.029
clarity, and consistency, we introduced

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.984
the Smart Stack,

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.494
a new way to see timely, relevant
widgets right over your Watch Face.

00:00:46.017 --> 00:00:49.742
And it’s in this Smart Stack,
where Live Activities come to Apple Watch.

00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:53.000
So in this session, we’re going to cover:

00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:55.435
the improvements we’re bringing
to Smart Stack,

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.132
which is the primary surface
for Live Activities;

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:02.640
all the different ways you can interact
with Live Activities on Apple Watch;

00:01:03.154 --> 00:01:07.726
and finally, visual guidelines for
how to craft a great Live Activity.

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.599
Let’s start with Smart Stack.

00:01:11.428 --> 00:01:15.098
In watchOS 11, we’re introducing
Suggested Widgets.

00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:17.679
These are widgets
that the system intelligently adds

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.773
or removes based on what’s relevant
in the moment.

00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:22.201
For example,

00:01:22.354 --> 00:01:25.992
this new precipitation widget shows up
15 minutes before it rains

00:01:26.468 --> 00:01:28.890
and then disappears once
the skies clear up.

00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:32.282
Or, if there’s music playing around you,

00:01:32.474 --> 00:01:36.053
the Shazam widget can help you
quickly identify what song is playing.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.826
And it too, disappears once
the music stops.

00:01:40.706 --> 00:01:43.650
Widgets in watchOS 11
can also be interactive,

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:47.230
enabling you to do things like tapping
this Home widget

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:48.725
to turn a nearby light on.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.413
But the biggest change to the Smart Stack
is the addition of Live Activities.

00:01:54.888 --> 00:01:56.474
Live Activities have changed

00:01:56.494 --> 00:01:59.232
the way we interact
with notifications on iPhone.

00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:02.685
Instead of receiving
multiple notifications

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:05.248
when you’re tracking
something like a ride to the airport,

00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:06.796
or your food delivery order,

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.553
you see a single,
dynamically updating Live Activity -

00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:12.100
right on your Lock Screen.

00:02:12.684 --> 00:02:14.924
On iPhone 15 and 15 Pro,

00:02:14.945 --> 00:02:17.921
Live Activities also appear
in the Dynamic Island

00:02:18.184 --> 00:02:20.499
allowing you to keep track
of Live Activities

00:02:20.694 --> 00:02:22.427
while you use your iPhone.

00:02:23.468 --> 00:02:26.903
In watchOS 11, when a Live Activity
begins on your iPhone,

00:02:26.923 --> 00:02:28.249
it automatically shows up

00:02:28.416 --> 00:02:30.700
at the top of the Smart Stack
on Apple Watch.

00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:33.991
So you can track its progress
just by raising your wrist.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.248
And, because the Smart Stack
can now open automatically,

00:02:38.518 --> 00:02:42.382
we’ve updated the corner clock to match
the design of your watch face.

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:47.249
To tell you more about how people interact
with Live Activities on Apple Watch,

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:48.796
here’s Taylor.

00:02:49.557 --> 00:02:50.653
Thanks, Ed.

00:02:50.764 --> 00:02:53.927
We’re really excited about
how Live Activities in watchOS 11

00:02:53.947 --> 00:02:57.311
bring even more timely,
relevant information to your wrist.

00:02:57.887 --> 00:03:00.237
Because of the Apple Watch’s
unique form factor

00:03:00.257 --> 00:03:01.811
and lightweight interaction model,

00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:04.846
we’ve designed Live Activities to
be experienced in a number of ways

00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:06.382
that are distinctive from iPhone.

00:03:07.551 --> 00:03:10.137
On Apple Watch,
when a Live Activity starts,

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:12.307
the Smart Stack is automatically presented

00:03:12.397 --> 00:03:14.582
and displays a widget
for that Live Activity.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.454
This allows you to see
the status of a Live Activity

00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:18.994
just by raising your wrist,

00:03:19.014 --> 00:03:21.551
without having to first rotate
the Digital Crown.

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.960
New, in watchOS 11,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.770
the Smart Stack will remain visible
when you put your wrist down

00:03:26.944 --> 00:03:29.316
so you can continue
to glance at both the time

00:03:29.337 --> 00:03:31.160
and the Live Activity you are tracking.

00:03:31.772 --> 00:03:34.754
When you tap on the Live Activity widget,
you’re taken into the app.

00:03:36.077 --> 00:03:37.598
If you don’t have an Apple Watch app,

00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:40.613
it will expand into a system
provided fullscreen view

00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:43.606
that contains a convenient button
to open your app on iPhone

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:46.668
so people can transition
to a richer experience there.

00:03:47.505 --> 00:03:50.371
But what if someone is in another app
when your Live Activity starts?

00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:53.623
To ensure people never miss
an update from your Live Activity

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.371
we’ve created the compact view

00:03:55.975 --> 00:03:58.934
When you’re interacting with an app
and a Live Activity receives an update,

00:03:59.095 --> 00:04:01.231
like the status of
your food delivery changing,

00:04:01.362 --> 00:04:04.003
a smaller, more compact
version of the Live Activity

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.644
appears at the bottom of the display.

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:10.112
If you pull up on this compact view,
it enlarges into the full widget.

00:04:10.456 --> 00:04:11.870
And if you tap on either,

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:14.362
you will be taken to the app
or fullscreen view.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.361
Like notifications,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.485
we’ve designed Live Activities
to demand the right amount of attention

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:22.706
based on how you are
interacting with Apple Watch.

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:25.550
If your wrist is down
and you are on your watch face,

00:04:25.816 --> 00:04:29.136
you can simply raise your wrist
to see a full-sized representation

00:04:29.258 --> 00:04:30.994
of the Live Activity you’re tracking.

00:04:31.545 --> 00:04:35.378
If you’re actively using Apple Watch,
this compact view is less interruptive

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:37.644
and allows you to see
that an update occurred

00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:39.745
without disrupting
the task you are performing.

00:04:40.633 --> 00:04:43.414
To tell you more about
the visual design of Live Activities,

00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:44.417
here’s Ed.

00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:48.925
Live Activities on Apple Watch
are meant to be highly glanceable,

00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:52.495
providing just the information you need,
and nothing more.

00:04:53.065 --> 00:04:57.347
On iPhone, Live Activities occupy
the dynamic island,

00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:00.628
which can expand
when there is an alerting update,

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.095
and then contract
back to its default state.

00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:06.564
And it’s in this default state

00:05:06.584 --> 00:05:09.776
where only the most critical information
remains visible.

00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:15.769
But, on Apple Watch,a smaller screen
demands a more focused approach,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.089
meaning: only the most critical information
should be shown at any given time.

00:05:21.903 --> 00:05:25.448
In watchOS 11, we’ve made
this effortless for developers,

00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:29.690
by automatically generating
Live Activities on Apple Watch

00:05:29.901 --> 00:05:32.675
by forwarding
and re-compositing assets from

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:35.034
the Dynamic Island’s Compact state.

00:05:35.455 --> 00:05:39.086
However, the best experiences
for Live Activities on Apple Watch

00:05:39.107 --> 00:05:41.667
are those that adopt
the Apple Watch size class.

00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:45.268
This enables developers to provide
more helpful information

00:05:45.288 --> 00:05:47.541
as well as a more engaging design.

00:05:48.078 --> 00:05:51.562
As you can see, there is
a significant difference in quality

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:54.072
and experience between these two options.

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:57.861
A common question
when designing Live Activities on Watch

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.268
is how much information
is too much or too little?

00:06:02.092 --> 00:06:05.711
To answer that, we recommend
showing only what is necessary

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:09.197
to communicate significant states
in the live activity.

00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:12.696
These are states that help
people understand progress,

00:06:12.822 --> 00:06:15.440
like how long until
your flight touches down.

00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:18.244
Or states that might require action,

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:21.252
like getting to the curb
because your Uber is arriving.

00:06:21.657 --> 00:06:24.908
Or these could just be states that
someone might really care about,

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:27.315
such as a change in the score of a game.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.508
Another common question

00:06:31.528 --> 00:06:34.424
is whether or not controls
make sense for your live activity.

00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:40.065
Controls are best for live activities
that need to be played, paused or resumed.

00:06:40.728 --> 00:06:44.736
For example, a workout, a timer,
or a voice memo.

00:06:45.746 --> 00:06:47.205
Whatever the control is,

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.924
we strongly recommend
sticking with just one,

00:06:50.266 --> 00:06:53.436
as multiple controls are
challenged by the small space,

00:06:53.658 --> 00:06:56.119
which also need to
provide enough information

00:06:56.293 --> 00:06:57.973
to communicate state.

00:06:58.854 --> 00:07:00.874
Speaking of space constraints.

00:07:00.895 --> 00:07:03.313
To help you make the most of the space

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:06.283
we recommend using
one of our existing design layouts

00:07:06.473 --> 00:07:09.438
which can accommodate
different levels of information density

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:10.916
and graphical elements.

00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:14.111
You can learn more about these layouts
in last year's session:

00:07:14.325 --> 00:07:17.461
"Design Widgets for the Smart Stack
on Apple Watch."

00:07:18.002 --> 00:07:21.131
If, however, you want to do
something completely custom,

00:07:21.533 --> 00:07:24.783
we recommend using standard
margins and text styles to ensure

00:07:24.874 --> 00:07:29.005
that your Live Activity both fits in with
the visual language of the Smart Stack

00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:31.916
and remains legible at a glance.

00:07:33.297 --> 00:07:37.190
The best way to learn about
Live Activities is to build one yourself.

00:07:37.505 --> 00:07:40.008
For that, we have a
wonderful session called,

00:07:40.207 --> 00:07:42.541
"Bring your Live Activity to Apple Watch."

00:07:42.955 --> 00:07:47.390
In that session, our engineering colleague
Anne will walk you through exactly

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.190
how to customize your
Live Activity for Apple Watch.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.149
It’s also worth mentioning
that Live Activities on Apple Watch

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.868
is an experience that has
only been made possible

00:07:56.888 --> 00:07:59.690
by building on the foundation
of other key features.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.104
These include the Smart Stack,
the Dynamic Island,

00:08:03.299 --> 00:08:05.966
and, of course, Live Activities on iPhone.

00:08:06.445 --> 00:08:08.712
If you’re interested in
getting a fuller understanding of

00:08:08.778 --> 00:08:10.193
each of these experiences,

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:14.401
we recommend checking out a few
of these sessions from previous years.

00:08:16.147 --> 00:08:20.296
We think Live Activities make Apple
Watch even more contextually intelligent,

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.646
so that a glance is all you need
to get the right information,

00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:24.561
at the right time.

00:08:25.162 --> 00:08:26.509
Thanks for joining us today,

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.850
we are so excited to see your
Live Activities in the Smart Stack.
